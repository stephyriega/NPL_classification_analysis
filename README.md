# NPL_classification_analysis
This is a code I created for the proyect related to MindGrowth while working at IPA Peru. I used spaCy, a Python software library for natural language processing. It aims to classify answers using dictionaries created for the intervention and process this information in wordclouds and frequency tables for the most common words. It's in progress and there are some improvements I want to do.
